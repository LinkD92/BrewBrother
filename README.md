BrewBrother app

Main purpose:
Knowledge increas in Kotlin and Android MVVM, dagger, navigation components.

Secondary purpose: (#offtopic)  Together with my friend we are dealing with amateour brewing. We often share the final product with others and receive plenty of questions about it.
Obvieously there is no chance to remember all the facts about products and usualy we do not have the documentation with us. Idea is to keep the details in the app.

Planned Basic functionaltiy:
  - adding, editing, removing brews
  - sharing brews with other users
  - notification when each of the brewing phase is about to finish.
  - most important: notification when beer is ready to drink :)
  
Planned additonal functionality:
  - reading QR code from the beer label to display details about beer.
  - automate fill of details from screenshot of the brewing manual (text reading from screenshot)
